/// Application entry point — bootstraps logging, error handling, and UI.
///
/// Invoked by the Flutter engine on Android, iOS, and desktop. Responsibilities:
/// 1. Open `runZonedGuarded` FIRST, before any Flutter binding call.
/// 2. Inside that guarded zone, call [WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized]
///    and [runApp] — so both observe the SAME zone and Flutter 3.41+'s
///    `debugCheckZone` assertion in `_runWidget` is satisfied.
/// 3. Bootstrap [FileLogger] (opens today's JSONL file, prunes oldest, sets
///    [Logger.root.level]) + wire error channels, all inside the same zone.
///
/// Zone layout (post-Batch D option (b), finding #P4):
///
///   Root zone
///     runZonedGuarded(() async {
///       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()  <-- guarded
///       FileLogger.bootstrap()                     <-- guarded
///       FlutterError.onError = ...                 <-- guarded
///       PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = ...  <-- guarded
///       runApp(ProviderScope(...))                 <-- guarded, same as
///                                                      ensureInitialized
///     }, onUncaught)
///
/// Why option (b) over option (a) (both in root zone):
/// Option (a) — ensureInitialized + runApp in root, runZonedGuarded around
/// logger/handlers only — was attempted in commit `56b164f` but failed the
/// user walk (`flutter run -d windows` still emitted `Zone mismatch` at
/// `runApp` according to the stack trace `main.<anonymous closure>` at
/// `main.dart:71`). Option (b) keeps BOTH calls inside the guarded zone,
/// which is the canonical Flutter pattern for `runZonedGuarded` bootstraps
/// (Flutter docs, `zoned_guarded` recipe) and removes any ambiguity: there
/// is a single zone from binding-init through `runApp` through the whole
/// widget tree's microtask lifetime.
///
/// The uncaught-zone handler covers EVERY async error raised in the guarded
/// zone, including during bootstrap (logger init, binding) AND during the
/// app's async lifetime. `FlutterError.onError` still fans framework errors
/// back to our reporter; `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` still catches
/// platform-channel / isolate-promoted errors.

  // Flutter 3.41+'s `debugCheckZone` asserts on in `_runWidget`.
  //
  // Finding #P4 (Batch D option (b)) — Phase 04 Runtime Walk caught a
  // `Zone mismatch` crash at `runApp` when `ensureInitialized` was in the
  // root zone and `runApp` was inside the guarded zone. Commit `56b164f`
  // flipped the shape to put both in the root zone with `runZonedGuarded`
