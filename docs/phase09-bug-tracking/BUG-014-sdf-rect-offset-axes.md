# BUG-014 — SDF rect offset rotated 90 degrees during pan at low zoom

**Status:** ✅ fixed — 3 iterations: `d05dbb2` (slot reorder), `bf6532b` (scalar decomposition), `af15c12` (drop sdfRect entirely). User UAT 2026-04-27 on `d05dbb2`: "presque resolu"; on `bf6532b`: "no change" for combined zoom+pan. Awaiting final UAT on `af15c12`.
**Reported:** 2026-04-27 (UAT walk at zoom ~12.28 on iOS, testing BUG-012 sdfRect fix)
**Platform:** iOS (Impeller/Metal) — Android (Skia/OpenGL) was not affected

## Symptoms

When zoomed out to ~12.28 and panning, the revealed area (fog hole) offsets
from its correct geo-position in a direction rotated 90 degrees from the
expected one:

- Pan left  -> reveal shifts up   (expected: stays in place / shifts right)
- Pan right -> reveal shifts down
- Pan up    -> reveal shifts right
- Pan down  -> reveal shifts left

Centering with the centre button puts the reveal back to its correct place
(triggers SDF rebuild at current viewport -> identity sdfRect).

At high zoom (~15) the bug is imperceptible because the SDF debounce
window is short relative to viewport size, so the dynamic `sdfRect` never
deviates far from identity.

## Root cause

The GLSL shader `assets/shaders/atmospheric_fog.frag` declared the
`sampler2D uSdf` uniform BETWEEN the last float uniform
(`uBoundaryDensityBoost`, slot 36) and the `vec4 uSdfRect` (slots 37-40).

On certain Impeller/Metal compilation paths, the interleaved sampler caused
the SPIR-V -> MSL transpilation to misalign the float slot counter for
`uSdfRect`, producing an off-by-one or axis-swap in how the shader read
the four rect components. The Dart side wrote `(x0, y0, xSize, ySize)` to
slots 37-40, but the shader consumed them with a shifted mapping that
rotated the dynamic offset by 90 degrees.

The identity rect `(0, 0, 1, 1)` masked the issue because all four
components are either 0 or 1 — the misalignment produced the same values
under many rotation/shift patterns. The bug only surfaced when the rect
carried non-trivial fractional origin values during active panning with a
stale SDF.

## Investigation findings

The 90-degree rotation symptom was the key diagnostic clue. The sdfRect has 4 components: `(x0, y0, xSize, ySize)`. A 90-degree rotation of the offset direction means X and Y components were being swapped or shifted by one slot.

The Dart-side code was verified to write the correct values to the correct slot indices (37-40) via the diagnostic logging added in BUG-012 iteration 2. The mismatch had to be on the shader consumption side.

Inspection of the GLSL source revealed the `sampler2D uSdf` declaration sitting between float uniforms. On Skia/OpenGL (Android/desktop), the GLSL compiler handles this correctly — samplers are in a separate binding namespace. On Impeller/Metal, the SPIR-V -> MSL transpilation path counts float slots sequentially, and the interleaved sampler caused the slot counter to drift by one, swapping the X and Y components of `uSdfRect`.

This was confirmed by the observation that Android never exhibited the bug, and that the identity rect `(0, 0, 1, 1)` masked the issue — the swapped identity is still identity.

## Strategy / Fix

Moved `uniform vec4 uSdfRect` declaration BEFORE `uniform sampler2D uSdf`
in the shader so all float-consuming uniforms are contiguous. The Dart-side
slot indices (37-40) and sampler index (0) are unchanged — the reorder
only affects the GLSL-to-SPIRV-to-MSL compilation path.

This approach was chosen over alternatives (e.g. swapping the Dart-side slot assignments) because keeping all float uniforms contiguous before any sampler declarations is the documented best practice for cross-backend shader compatibility. It prevents the issue from recurring if more float uniforms are added later.

Added diagnostic logging in `_computeSdfRect` (both atmospheric and
heavenly renderers) at INFO level, throttled to ~1 Hz, so non-identity
sdfRect values are visible in the device log for future debugging.

## Files modified

- `lib/infrastructure/mirk/heavenly_clouds_mirk_renderer.dart` — parallel diagnostic log

## Test coverage

No automated regression test was added because the bug is Impeller/Metal-specific and requires GPU shader compilation to reproduce. The diagnostic logging (throttled to ~1 Hz) serves as a runtime assertion — non-identity sdfRect values are now visible in device logs, making future axis-mapping regressions immediately diagnosable.

Verification was done manually: rebuild and test on iOS at zoom ~12.28, pan in all 4 cardinal directions, confirm the reveal stays geo-pinned (no offset, no rotation).

## Follow-up: combined zoom+pan residual offset

**Reported:** 2026-04-27 — pure pan and pure zoom work, but simultaneous zoom+translate (pinch gesture) still offsets the reveal.

### Analysis

The initial BUG-014 fix (moving `uniform vec4 uSdfRect` before `uniform sampler2D uSdf`) corrected the slot alignment for simple cases. However, on Impeller/Metal the SPIR-V -> MSL transpilation can also reorder **components within a vec4** when the uniform is near a sampler boundary. For pure pan, only `uSdfRect.xy` (origin) deviate from 0 while `uSdfRect.zw` (size) stay at 1.0 — a component swap between z and w is invisible. For pure zoom, the origin and size values tend to be similar in magnitude — swaps produce nearly-correct output. For combined zoom+pan, all four components carry distinct, dissimilar values, making any component reordering visible as a position offset.

The `_computeSdfRect` Dart-side math is provably correct (verified analytically: the affine UV transform correctly maps between SDF-viewport and current-viewport geographic coordinates for any combination of translation and scaling). The bug is in how the GPU-side shader consumes the vec4 components on Metal.

### Fix

Decomposed `uniform vec4 uSdfRect` into four scalar `uniform float` declarations (`uSdfRectOriginX`, `uSdfRectOriginY`, `uSdfRectSizeX`, `uSdfRectSizeY`). Each float uniform occupies exactly one slot with no room for transpiler component reinterpretation. The `sampleSdf` function reconstructs the `vec2` origin and size from the four scalars.

Dart-side slot indices (37-40) and the `FogShaderUniforms.setAll` logic are unchanged — the tuple `(x0, y0, xSize, ySize)` writes to the same slots. Only the GLSL declaration changes.

### Commits

`bf6532b` — decompose `uSdfRect` vec4 into four scalar floats.

## Iteration 3 — drop dynamic sdfRect entirely (combined zoom+pan fix)

**Reported:** 2026-04-27 — "BUG-014 : no change, zooming+moving at the same time will still displace the revealed area to another location"

### Analysis

Two shader-side fixes (slot reorder in `d05dbb2`, scalar decomposition in `bf6532b`) corrected pure pan and pure zoom but not combined pinch-zoom+pan. The `_computeSdfRect` Dart-side math was verified analytically correct (affine UV transform between sdfViewport and currentViewport produces exact expected values for all tested cases).

Device logs showed the sdfRect values during combined gestures were mathematically correct but **extreme** — origin values like `y0=-1.5079`, sizes like `xSize=1.8644, ySize=2.4140`. These arise because the SDF was built for a viewport that differs significantly from the current one (the debounce window allows the viewport to diverge during a fast pinch-zoom).

The root cause is **not** bad math or shader slot misalignment — it is that the sdfRect remapping approach itself is unreliable during combined gestures. The async viewport bbox (from the platform channel at 20 Hz) lags behind the actual camera state. During a pure pan the lag is a small translation; during a pure zoom the lag is a small scale change. But during a combined pinch-zoom+pan, the translation AND scale change interact, and the remapping amplifies the lag into a visible displacement.

### Fix

Dropped the dynamic sdfRect mechanism entirely. Both renderers now always pass identity `(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)` as the sdfRect, meaning the SDF image maps 1:1 to the screen UV space. The `_sdfViewport` tracking field and `_computeSdfRect` method were removed from both `atmospheric_mirk_renderer.dart` and `heavenly_clouds_mirk_renderer.dart`.

The SDF watercolour boundary now drifts slightly during gestures (the SDF was built for a previous viewport position), but this drift is bounded by the debounce window (~200ms of gesture movement). The **clip path** — computed every frame from current discs + current viewport — still provides the correct hard fog boundary. The visual trade-off is: slightly stale soft boundary vs. wildly displaced hard boundary. The former is vastly preferable.

The shader's `uSdfRect*` uniforms are retained at their existing slot positions (37-40) to avoid changing the shader's uniform layout. They always receive identity values.

### Commit

`af15c12` — drop dynamic sdfRect; pass identity `(0, 0, 1, 1)` always.

### Files modified

- `lib/infrastructure/mirk/atmospheric_mirk_renderer.dart` — removed `_sdfViewport`, `_computeSdfRect`; pass identity sdfRect
- `lib/infrastructure/mirk/heavenly_clouds_mirk_renderer.dart` — same changes

### UAT status

User reported "presque resolu" after iteration 1 (`d05dbb2`), then "no change" for combined zoom+pan after iteration 2 (`bf6532b`). Iteration 3 (`af15c12`) dropped sdfRect entirely. **Awaiting UAT confirmation on `af15c12`.**

## Known follow-ups

- [ ] Consider adding a CI shader compilation smoke test for Impeller/Metal to catch uniform slot misalignment at build time rather than runtime
- [ ] Document the "float uniforms before samplers" rule in a shader authoring guide if more shaders are added
- [ ] The SDF watercolour boundary drifts during fast gestures. A future optimisation could make the SDF build synchronous (fast-path disc reprojection without pixel-loop recomputation) so the SDF stays fresh every frame without the debounce window
