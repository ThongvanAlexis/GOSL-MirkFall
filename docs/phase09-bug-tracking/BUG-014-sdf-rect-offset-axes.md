# BUG-014 — Fog overlay doesn't track map movement (SDF in screen space, not map space)

**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS — image source approach failed (iteration 5), pivoting to Canvas transform (iteration 6)
**Reported:** 2026-04-27 (UAT walk at zoom ~12.28 on iOS, post-BUG-010 disc refactor)
**Platform:** cross-platform (Flutter overlay architecture, not GPU-specific)

## Symptoms

1. **Offset during pan/zoom/combined gestures:** The revealed area displaces from its correct geo-position. Pure pan and pure zoom were partially fixed, but combined pinch-zoom+pan still displaces.
2. **Fog moves with the camera:** The fog overlay moves as if painted on the screen, not as actual fog on the map. When you pan, the fog slides with the camera for 1-2 frames then snaps back. This is the ROOT symptom — the offset bugs are consequences.
3. **White ellipse artefact:** Fast zoom+move creates a persistent large white ellipse on the boundary.

## Root cause (architectural)

The mirk (fog) is rendered as a **Flutter `CustomPainter` widget overlaid on top of the MapLibre map widget**. It lives in screen space, not map space.

- MapLibre renders map tiles natively at 60fps via Metal/Vulkan/OpenGL.
- The Flutter overlay repaints when: (a) the viewport provider delivers a new bbox, (b) the widget tree rebuilds.
- There is inherent **latency** between the map's native camera movement and the Flutter overlay catching up — the overlay bbox comes from a platform channel query at ~20 Hz, not synced to the map's GPU frame.

Every fog-of-war application solves this by rendering the fog **as part of the map's rendering pipeline** (a map layer), not as an overlay. The fog texture is in world coordinates; camera movement changes the UV sampling, not the texture.

## Iterations attempted (all insufficient)

### Iteration 1 — Shader slot reorder (`d05dbb2`)

**Hypothesis:** Impeller's SPIR-V→MSL transpiler misaligned the `uSdfRect` float slots because `uniform sampler2D uSdf` was declared between float uniforms.
**Fix:** Moved `uSdfRect` declaration before the sampler.
**Result:** Fixed pure pan + pure zoom. Combined zoom+pan still broke.
**Status:** Kept (the slot ordering fix is correct regardless).

### Iteration 2 — vec4 → 4 scalar uniforms (`bf6532b`)

**Hypothesis:** Metal reorders vec4 components near a sampler boundary.
**Fix:** Decomposed `uniform vec4 uSdfRect` into 4 scalar `uniform float`.
**Result:** No change for combined zoom+pan.
**Status:** Kept (scalar uniforms are more robust regardless).

### Iteration 3 — Drop dynamic sdfRect entirely (`af15c12`)

**Hypothesis:** The sdfRect remapping math is unreliable due to viewport bbox platform-channel lag.
**Fix:** Always pass identity sdfRect `(0, 0, 1, 1)`. Accept that the SDF watercolour boundary drifts during gestures, let the clip path provide the hard boundary, rebuild SDF when gesture settles (200ms debounce).
**Result:** User rejected. The revealed area stays in place during gestures (stale SDF) and snaps to position after rebuild — ugly. Fast zoom+move creates a persistent white ellipse.
**Status:** ⬅️ REVERTED (`f5d5b27`).

### Iteration 4 — Build SDF in disc-bbox coordinates (`a1d58ad`)

**Hypothesis:** Building the SDF in world coordinates (disc bounding box) instead of viewport coordinates — the fog-of-war standard approach. SDF rebuilds only on disc-list change, not viewport change. Per-frame UV remapping from screen to disc-bbox space.
**Fix:** `buildFromDiscs` returns `SdfBuildResult` with both image + disc bbox. Renderers compute `_computeSdfRect` per frame mapping disc bbox onto current viewport.
**Result:** Made things worse — weird ellipse boundary, no correct repositioning.
**Status:** ⬅️ REVERTED (`f5d5b27`).

## Why all 4 iterations failed

All attempts tried to keep the fog as a **Flutter screen-space overlay** and compensate for the mismatch between screen space and map space via SDF coordinate tricks. The fundamental problem is that:

1. The viewport bbox arrives via platform channel with 1-2 frame lag.
2. During combined gestures (pinch-zoom+pan), both translation AND scale change per frame — any remapping amplifies the lag.
3. The `CustomPainter` is repainted after the map's native rendering, so the fog is always 1+ frames behind the map.

**No amount of SDF coordinate trickery can fix a screen-space overlay lagging behind a native map renderer.**

## Decision: render fog as a MapLibre custom layer

**Decided:** 2026-04-27, after iteration 4 revert.

The fog must be rendered **inside MapLibre's rendering pipeline** so it moves with the map natively at 60fps, with zero lag.

### Options evaluated

| Option | Description | Effort | Lag |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|
| **(A) MapLibre raster tile source** | Generate fog as raster tiles (256×256 per tile), inject as a MapLibre raster source. MapLibre composites them with the map natively. | Medium (~3-5 days) | Zero |
| **(B) `onCameraMove` transform** | Keep Flutter overlay but apply an affine `Transform` widget matching the map's camera delta. | Small (~1 day) | Low (1 frame) |
| **(C) MapLibre custom GL layer** | Inject a custom OpenGL/Metal draw call via MapLibre's custom layer API. | Large (~1 week) | Zero |
| **(D) MapLibre fill-extrusion or fill layer** | Use MapLibre's built-in polygon fill layers with the revealed area as inverted GeoJSON. | Medium (~2-3 days) | Zero |

**Recommended: Option A (raster tile source)** — MapLibre is designed to composite raster tiles. We generate the fog as tiles on the CPU (reusing the SDF builder logic), inject them as a raster source, and MapLibre handles compositing, caching, and camera tracking. No shader porting needed — the fog texture IS the tile.

**Option D** is the simplest if the fog doesn't need the watercolour/noise visual effects (just a solid semi-transparent fill with a smooth boundary). Worth prototyping first.

**Option B** is a quick win for reducing lag from ~3 frames to ~1 frame, but doesn't eliminate it. Could be a stop-gap while Option A is built.

### Performance (user question: "can the phone handle 60fps?")

Yes. The GPU is ALREADY rendering the fog shader at ~60fps in the current Flutter overlay. Moving it to MapLibre's pipeline is the same GPU work in a different pipeline. The SDF texture (256×256) is tiny. The heavy CPU work (`buildFromDiscs`) only runs on disc-list change (~1/sec), not per frame. Mobile games render fog-of-war over 3D terrain with lighting + shadows + particles at 60fps on the same hardware.

## Current state after reverts

After reverting `af15c12` and `a1d58ad` (revert commit `f5d5b27` + `ebb7097`), the codebase is back to the state after iteration 1+2:
- Shader has correct scalar uniform slots (iterations 1+2 kept)
- SDF builds in viewport coordinates (original architecture)
- Viewport-only changes debounced 200ms (BUG-012 fix kept)
- The fog still moves with the camera (screen-space overlay)
- Combined zoom+pan still displaces the reveal (iterations 1+2 didn't fully fix this)

## Implementation: MapLibre image source (commit `5902d4e`)

Instead of pure Option C (custom GL layer), we chose a **hybrid approach**: the fog is
rendered offscreen using the existing Flutter FragmentShader — preserving ALL visual
effects (watercolour boundary, wisps, noise) — then pushed to MapLibre as a
geo-pinned image source at ~20 fps. MapLibre composites it in map-space at 60 fps,
so camera tracking is native with zero lag.

### Key files changed

- `lib/domain/map/map_view.dart` — new `addFogImageSource` / `updateFogImageSource` /
  `removeFogImageSource` methods on the map view interface
- `lib/infrastructure/map/maplibre_map_view.dart` — MapLibre `addImageSource` /
  `updateImageSource` + raster layer wiring
- `lib/infrastructure/mirk/offscreen_fog_renderer.dart` — **new**: renders
  MirkRenderer to PNG bytes via `PictureRecorder`
- `lib/presentation/widgets/mirk_overlay.dart` — **rewritten**: invisible controller
  that pushes fog frames to MapLibre instead of painting a screen-space overlay
- `lib/presentation/screens/map_screen.dart` — simplified wrappers

### Verification

- All 1045 tests pass, `flutter analyze` clean.
- Animation updates at ~20 fps, throttled by
  `kMirkFogMapLayerUpdateIntervalMs = 50ms`.
- Camera tracking runs at 60 fps natively inside MapLibre — zero frame lag.

## Iteration 5 — MapLibre image source (commits `5902d4e`, `cbd25ba`, `045143f`)

**Hypothesis:** Render the fog offscreen and push it to MapLibre as a geo-pinned image source. MapLibre composites it in map-space at 60fps — zero camera lag.

**Implementation:** 
- MirkOverlay rewritten as invisible controller pushing PNG to MapLibre's `addImageSource`/`updateImageSource`
- OffscreenFogRenderer: renders MirkRenderer to PNG via PictureRecorder
- Padded viewport (3x visible area) to allow panning without edge exposure

**Result:** Three fundamental raster-image issues:
1. **Pixelated boundary** — 512×512 image covering 3x the viewport = ~170 effective pixels per screen dimension. The watercolour boundary became thick and blocky.
2. **Zoom stretching** — image source is geo-pinned, so zooming stretches/compresses the raster image. The fog noise pattern scales unnaturally.
3. **Re-pin snapping** — when the camera drifts past 50% of the padding, the image is re-pinned to new coordinates, causing a visible snap/jump.

**Root cause:** The image source approach is fundamentally wrong for animated, resolution-dependent fog. A raster image pinned to geo-coordinates will always degrade on zoom and look pixelated when covering a large area. The fog NEEDS to be rendered per-pixel at screen resolution every frame — that's what the shader does beautifully.

**Status:** ⬅️ REVERTED. Pivoting to Option B (Canvas transform).

## Iteration 6 — Canvas-level affine transform (Option B)

**Hypothesis:** Keep the Flutter CustomPaint overlay with the existing shader at full screen resolution. Instead of remapping the SDF per-pixel in the shader (which created compound errors during combined zoom+pan), apply a Canvas-level affine transform (translate + scale) BEFORE the renderer paints. The GPU's matrix pipeline handles the combined zoom+pan as a single operation.

**Fix:**
- `_MirkPainter.paint()` computes the affine transform from the SDF viewport → current viewport
- Canvas.translate(tx, ty) + Canvas.scale(sx, sy) applied before renderer.paint()
- Shader's sdfRect always identity (0,0,1,1) — the Canvas handles all remapping
- ~1 frame lag (16ms) remains inherent to Flutter-on-top-of-MapLibre architecture
- All visual effects preserved at full screen resolution (curl, drift, hue, watercolour boundary)

**Status:** 🟡 IMPLEMENTING

## Next step

UAT walk on device to verify the fog tracks map movement correctly during pan,
zoom, and combined pan+zoom gestures.
